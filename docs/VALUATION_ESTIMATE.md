## Comparable Market Context

| Company/App | Category | Valuation Reference |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Braille Skateboarding | Skate media/community | ~$5M+ (YouTube + merch) |
| The Berrics | Skate media platform | ~$10M+ (video + brand deals) |

## Key Value Drivers

1. **User acquisition cost and retention** — Sticky daily habits (check-ins, games) are worth far more than downloads
2. **S.K.A.T.E. game engagement** — Viral loops through friend challenges and clip sharing
3. **TrickMint / UGC** — User-generated trick clips drive virality and retention
4. **Mobile launch** — Consumer social lives on mobile; Expo foundation is ready
5. **Community authenticity** — "Proof over hype" resonates with skate culture
