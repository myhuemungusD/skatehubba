# Mobile

Status

- Scaffolding only. Not wired to CI or production.
- Minimal Detox E2E scaffold added (smoke test + config).

Purpose

- Placeholder for future mobile work.

Safety

- No runtime dependencies. Safe to ignore or delete until active development starts.
- E2E scripts require native projects (ios/android) to exist before running.
